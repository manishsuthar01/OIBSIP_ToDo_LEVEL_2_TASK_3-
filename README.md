[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/manishsuthar01/OIBSIP_ToDo_LEVEL_2_TASK_3-)

A clean, minimal, and responsive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently and works perfectly across all devices — desktop, tablet, and mobile. The app features a modern user interface with a glassmorphism effect.

## Features

-   **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks using the input field.
-   **Mark as Completed**: Check off tasks to mark them as done. The task will be visually distinguished with a line-through.
-   **Delete Tasks**: Instantly remove tasks from the list with a delete button.
-   **Filter Tasks**: Filter the task list to view **All**, **Active**, or **Completed** tasks.
-   **Local Storage Persistence**: Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they remain available even after you close or refresh the page.
-   **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a great user experience on any device.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the application.
-   **CSS3**: For styling, including the responsive design and modern glass-like appearance.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the application's logic and interactivity.
-   **localStorage API**: For client-side storage to persist user tasks.
